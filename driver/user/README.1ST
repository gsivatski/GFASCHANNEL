                            LOCAL FILE NAMING CONVENTION
                            ----------------------------
   If you will add your own driver or simulator sourse files to this directory,
than you should keep in mind the naming convention rule:

If the files are for real driver - than they should end with "Drvr.c" suffix!
For example:
     MyAddedSrcDrvr.c
               |----|
                 |
                 V
             Required suffix for added driver src code.

If the files are for simulator - than they should end with "Sim.c" suffix!
For example:
     MyAddedSrcSim.c
               |---|
                 |
                 V
             Required suffix for added simulator src code.


This convention is used in Makefiles for source code compilation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Use GfaschannelVersion[Drvr/Sim].h file (that is located in
'../../include/user' directory) to change current real/simulator driver
version. Like this it's possible to track driver versions. The first version
that driver will have is zero (0). Note, that version is automatically
increased by one (1) when 'cpUsrPt' is used to move user-defined src code from
one directory to another.
